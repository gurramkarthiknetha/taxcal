## About This Project

The KoinX Tax Loss Harvesting Tool was developed to address the complex challenge of tax optimization for cryptocurrency investors. In the volatile world of crypto assets, investors often face significant tax implications from their trading activities. This tool simplifies the process of implementing tax loss harvesting strategies, which can substantially reduce an investor's tax burden.

### What is Tax Loss Harvesting?

Tax loss harvesting is a strategy where investors sell assets that have experienced a loss to offset capital gains realized from selling assets that have appreciated in value. This approach can reduce the overall tax liability for the current tax year.

For cryptocurrency investors, this strategy is particularly valuable due to the high volatility in the market. Our tool helps identify which assets would be most beneficial to sell for tax purposes, providing real-time calculations of the potential tax savings.

### Project Purpose

This project was created to:
- Demystify tax optimization strategies for crypto investors
- Provide an intuitive interface for making informed tax decisions
- Help users maximize their after-tax returns
- Visualize complex tax implications in a straightforward manner

## Overview

The Tax Loss Harvesting Tool allows users to:

- View their current cryptocurrency holdings and associated gains/losses
- Select assets to sell for tax loss harvesting
- See real-time calculations of tax implications before and after harvesting
- Sort holdings by various metrics including short-term and long-term gains/losses
- Optimize their tax strategy with an intuitive visual interface

## Features

- **Interactive Holdings Table**: View your cryptocurrency portfolio with detailed information about each asset
- **Real-time Tax Calculations**: See immediate updates to your tax liability as you select different assets
- **Sorting Functionality**: Sort your holdings by short-term gains/losses, long-term gains/losses, or total value
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Informative Tooltips**: Helpful guidance on how to use the tool effectively
- **Tax Savings Summary**: Clear visualization of potential tax savings

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design principles
- **State Management**: React Hooks for efficient state management
- **Development**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for rapid development

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture, with clear separation of concerns:

- **Components**: Modular UI elements that handle specific parts of the interface
- **Data Flow**: Unidirectional data flow using React's state and props system
- **Calculations**: Tax calculations are performed in real-time as users interact with the interface

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Custom CSS Over Frameworks**: We chose to use custom CSS instead of utility-based frameworks to maintain precise control over the styling and ensure the design matches exactly with the provided specifications.

2. **Responsive Design Approach**: The application uses a mobile-first approach with media queries to ensure optimal display across all device sizes. Tables use horizontal scrolling on small screens to maintain data integrity.

3. **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, tooltips, and visual feedback are implemented to enhance user experience and make the interface intuitive.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Sorting operations are optimized to minimize re-renders
   - The "View all" feature limits initial rendering to improve load times
   - State updates are batched where possible to reduce unnecessary re-renders
